Objets and its internal representation

	Objects, in JavaScript, is important data-type. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s other data-types(Number, String, Boolean).Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types
 	It's a Collection of “key: value” pairs. 



Syntax
{ 
  name : value pairs,
} 

Example:

Consider a candidate having properties like name, number,address,age,mail

we can represent the set of data in objects as follows

var M
M = {
name : Mani,
number : 9566991210,
address : xxx,
age : 23,
mail : xyz@gmail.com,
subjects : ['x' , 'y' , 'z' ]
};

console.log(M);

output:
 {
name : Mani,
number : 9566991210,
address : xxx,
age : 23,
mail : xyz@gmail.com,
}

console.log(M['number']); // dynamic type
console.log(M.number);

Output : 9566991210

console.log(M['mail'][1]); // to print the specipic data in an array 

Output : y
