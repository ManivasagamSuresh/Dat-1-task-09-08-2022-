HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCAL

HTTP is used in client-server communication.By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
There are several versions of HTTP available. But HTTP/1.1 which is the standardized protocal found in 1997.
Latest one is HTTP/2 which was found in year 2015.

MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HTTP/1.1 VS HTTP/2.0

PRIORITIZATION

		In HTTP/2, there is a control over prioritization.Developers will decide which page resources will load first, every time. 

MULTIPLEXING 

 		 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one by one, so if any one of resource cannot be loaded, it will block all the other resources yet to be loaded. But in HTTP/2 is able to send multiple streams of data at once, so that no resource will blocks any other resource. HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages. so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.


HEADER COMPRESSION

	      To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. HTTP/2 uses  HPACK Method for compression that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet, resulting in faster loading.
